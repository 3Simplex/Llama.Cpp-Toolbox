Version 0.31.0

This commit significantly improves the installation process and streamlines the development setup.

New in this merge:

- Auto launch in developer console. *Required for llama.cpp build process.
Changes:
- Improved Install Logic: Refactored the installation script for better reliability and maintainability.
- VS Tools Integration: Automatically detects and loads the Visual Studio developer console if available, simplifying build and development.
- Windows Curl Installation: Installs Curl for Windows, providing required tooling.
- Removed unnecessary build flag: Removed `-DLLAMA_CURL=OFF` build flag, as curl is now a dependency.
