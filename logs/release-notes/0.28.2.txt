Version 0.28.2
New in this merge:
Modify build optiion by ThiloteE.

Changes:

- Build
  - Disable cURL requirement in build options "-DLLAMA_CURL=OFF" until we figure out that issue.
    - This function allows a person to download models from huggingface directly via llama.cpp, it seems to be problematic in windows with llama.cpp.
    - LlamaCpp-Toolbox gets around this by providing git functionality to download models directly on the main form.
