Version 0.28.0
New in this merge:
Introduced control vector generator, a config.json backup and initial restAPI call functions.

Features:

- llama-cvector-generator
  - Easily generate control vectors for .gguf models.
  - Add argument options after the provided task executable cvector-generator.
  - A simple example task has been provided, modify as needed.
  - In the example I included arguments for context and NGL.
  - The NGL setting enables the GPU, remove it to process on CPU only. "-ngl 10" (use more if possible) 
  - I set the context setting low to allow for more GPU layers. "-c 2048" (use more if possible)
  - Ensure your control example text files use the correct chat template for the model.
  - Find more information from llama.cpp on github.

- Chat argument example:  --control-vector-scaled "full-path/cvector.guff" value
  - Use it with cli or server, provide the argument followed by the full file path and a value between 1.0 and -1.0
  - I found that with a value close to 1.0 the example produces delirious depression.
  - I found that the example produces neutral emotion with a value of 0.
  - I found that with a value close to -1.0 the example produces delirious happiness.
  - Apply as many control vectors as you want.
  - Find more information from llama.cpp on github.

- Update-Config
  - A backup is created before upgrade occurs, bak.config.json is found in the same directory.

- Toolbox-Functions-REST
  - The beginning of restAPI support for future projects.
  - This is a work in progress both at llama.cpp and here, expect changes.
  - This can be found in \modules and is not yet imported when running the toolbox.
  - An extensive example of using ChatCompletion is provided
  - Get-ChatCompletion for chat style messaging.
	  - SendMessage combines sending receiving and saving.
	  - Save-MessageArray is used for saving conversations.
	  - Load-MessageArray is used for loading existing conversations.
	  - InitializeChat get existing chat or start new one.
	  - Import-Messages from other chats.
	  - Import-SystemPrompt will load a saved system prompt. (WIP)
  - Get-Completion for completion requests.
  - Get-Slots used to get properties of the server.
  - Get-Health used to get health of the server.
  - Get-Props used to get properties of the server.
  - Set-Props used to set properties of the server. (WIP)
  - Save-KVCache this is labeled by llama.cpp as 'not production ready'.
  - Restore-KVCache this is labeled by llama.cpp as 'not production ready'.
